# DnD-Campaign

This is a small project I am working on on the side for my DnD campaign while I continue on my coding journey. I finished the HTML and CSS portion of this code right after I finished the CSS section of a Web Developers Bootcamp. The JS was slowly implemented as I went over JavaScript Basics. I decided to upload this version before I go in and really clean up the code, which I won't do until I finish the bootcamp. 

The JS functions are functions I slightly utilize throughout my campaign when needed and can be accessed through the console.
